# XGBoost_house_pricing
XGBoosRegression model learning

House pricing data analysis with Machine Learning in this project, I explored and cleaned the data, built a machine learning model (logistic regression), and made predictions.

Technologies Used: Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (XGBoost regression, data splitting)

The model needs to be reconfigured as it is prediction results are no good.
